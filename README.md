# What is Fixitt?
Fixitt is a backend system project, providing a real time software service for the ones in need of help in these Areas :

* Garden Care
* Furniture Repairing
* House Cleaning 
and so on..

Consists of two main models (Users, Couriers).

Couriers are the ones who give service to Users.
The algorithm behind uses geolocation to chooses the most nearest Couriers to Users in an efficient way to save time and improve effieciency.


[Google Maps Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/intro) is used to detect distances and timings.
